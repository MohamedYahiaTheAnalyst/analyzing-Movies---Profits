## Conclusion

> I Investigated TMDb data set which contains data about more than 10000 movies. I focused on the profit. To investigate it , I solved some problems in the data and created a new column for profit.Also, each row in genres columns have muliple values. I solved this problem by extracting the unique values for genres. 
I found that Animatin movies have the highest average profit. On top of that, I found that movies with hiegher voting and popularity have hiegher profits but I did not use a statiscal model. so, I can't infere the strenth of the relationship between voting or popularity with profit.
